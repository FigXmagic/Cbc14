# **About Me**

My family migrated to united states from El Salvador back in the 80's escaping a civalwar, I am a first generation Salvadorian-American, and I never took advantage of schooling when I was younger so now I’m trying my best to push myself past my boundaries and comfort zone. I know there is a lot of knowledge out there and I want to learn as much as I can in my lifetime and hopefully apply those skills for something greater than myself.


I came across TheClubhou.se accidently from my brother in law who moved down here with my from NY with his family and have then decided that since I was coming down for a fresh start that this program wis aligned which my current interest in life as far as a career in being a developer. The Clubhou.se seemed like the perfect investment in myself to learn how to program to implement these skills to build a standard web application from the front-end design to back-end data management to start my journey as a Web Developer.


As I go thru the journey of of becoming a Web Devolper I plan on using those skill to help contribute to a DAO Project I am currently invovled in that is on the Stellar Blockchain called THE JPEG DAO where the members collaborate to provide the commnuity with amazing NFT experiences!
