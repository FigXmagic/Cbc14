## I Ching Astrology calculates your Energy Cycle Charts based on I Ching Astrology.
Im currently on Energy Cycle Chart 8 of 9

Base Number is Present in Thunder Year
After the inert period of Earth year comes the year of thunder. This year you should burst into activity with a roar. Just like the flashes of lightning, you can surprise the world with new flashes of your creative genius, new ideas and thoughts. With much noise just like the thunder, you would draw the attention of the others. The flashes of lightning declare the coming of rainy season, the season of renewed life, refreshing changes and fertility.

Likewise, this year ushers the advent of a happy and fruitful time. But in order to attain accomplishment, you must take proper care to sow the seeds of new possibilities now. The time frame is ultimately favorable to initiate a new project, to put your life on a solid base.

Changes will be noticed not so much in the outer world as in your inner world. You will work hard to add new dimensions in your life. You are building new foundations for the future. You will nurture the outgoing aspect of your personality, enjoy the company of your friends and spread your message. The thunder year is dominated by the wood element. If you have a weak liver or bile related syndromes, those complications can be aggravated.

# **About Me**

My family migrated to united states from El Salvador back in the 80's escaping a civil war, I am a first generation Salvadorian American, and I never took advantage of schooling when I was younger so now I’m trying my best to push myself past my boundaries and comfort zone. I know there is a lot of knowledge out there and I want to learn as much as I can in my lifetime and hopefully apply those skills for something greater than myself.


I came across The Clubhouse accidently from my brother in law who moved down here with my from NY with his family and have then decided that since I was coming down for a fresh start that this program wis aligned which my current interest in life as far as a career in being a developer. The Clubhou.se seemed like the perfect investment in myself to learn how to program to implement these skills to build a standard web application from the front-end design to back-end data management to start my journey as a Web Developer.


As I go thru the journey of becoming a Web Developer I plan on using those skill to help contribute to a DAO Project I am currently involved in that is on the Stellar Blockchain called THE JPEG DAO where the members collaborate to provide the community with amazing NFT experiences!
